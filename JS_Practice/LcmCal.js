// Implement a Range-Based LCM Calculator

// In this lab, you will create a function that takes an array of two numbers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of those two numbers and all the numbers between them.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories

//     You should have a smallestCommons function that accepts an array of two numbers as an argument.
//     The smallestCommons function should return the smallest common multiple that is evenly divisible by both numbers and all sequential numbers in the range between them.
//     The function should handle input where the two numbers are not in numerical order.

function smallestCommons(arr) {
     let min = Math.min(arr[0], arr[1]);
     let max = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);

     let ans = max;

     while (true) {
          let isLCM = true;
          for (let i = min; i <= max; i++) {
               if (ans % i !== 0) {
                    isLCM = false;
                    break;
               }
          }

          if (isLCM) {
               return ans;
          }
          ans += max;
     }
